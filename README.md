# Ecommerce
I developed an e-commerce website using HTML and CSS. It features a home page with a navigation bar, promotional banner, product categories, and featured items. Users can view product listings and detailed pages, manage their cart, and use a checkout page with forms for shipping and payment, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.
